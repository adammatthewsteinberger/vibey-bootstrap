# Made with love by Vibey, the auto-vibecoding machine by Adam Matthew Steinberger.
"""Compatibility alias for the standalone `vibey-gh` package.

This subpackage shipped the GitHub automation in 4.1.0. In 4.2.0 the code moved to
[vibey-gh](https://pypi.org/project/vibey-gh/), which has no dependencies, because
release tooling runs in every CI job of every repository that adopts it — and reaching it
through this package meant installing the Azure SDK and OpenTelemetry to run a stdlib CLI.

`vibey-gh` is a hard dependency here, so every import that worked before still works:

    from vibey_bootstrap.gh import merge_train          # the module
    from vibey_bootstrap.gh.config import GhConfig      # and its submodules

Both now resolve to the same objects `vibey_gh` exposes — not copies of them, so patching
one is patching the other. New code should import `vibey_gh` directly.
